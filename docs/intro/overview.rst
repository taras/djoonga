Overview
========
Djoonga is Python tool, designed to simplify the everyday tasks of a
Joomla developer. It brings together the best aspects of Joomla! CMS and Django
Web Development Framework to leverage the unique advantages of each system.

What's so special about Djoonga?
================================
First of all, it's not just another Joomla! component, in fact, it's not even a
Joomla! extension of any kind. It doesn't even run on PHP. Djoonga is a system
that is built using Django at it's core and it interact with Joomla to leverage
Django's capabilities to expand Joomla's abilities.

The great thing about Djoonga is that it doesn't add more clutter to Joomla. It
interacts with Joomla's database without breaking backwards compatibility.It can
be added to any existing Joomla project without breaking anything or doing any
migration.

It's like that perfect new tool that you can just grab and start using.

It's not an improvement, it's a new way to work 
===============================================
Henry Ford once said, 'If Iâ€™d asked people what they wanted, they would have
asked for a better horse'. I think this quote is very applicable to Djoonga.
It's not an incremental improvement on how your work right now, it's a new way
to work.
