Overview
========
Djoonga is Python tool, designed to simplify the everyday tasks of a
Joomla developer. It brings together the best aspects of Joomla! CMS and Django
Web Development Framework to leverage the unique advantages and together make
possible what was not possible previously.

What can Djoonga do for you?
========================
Djoonga can help you provide a more professional and reliable Joomla service.
Joomla is a great starting point, but it's not enough. After building a bunch of
sites for clients and realizing that it never ends, you will start asking
yourself, What can I do better? How can I make more money and do less work? 
How can i offer a better service while simplifying my life, well Djoonga help
you get all these.

What's so special about Djoonga?
================================
First of all, it's not just another Joomla! component, in fact, it's not even a
Joomla! extension of any kind. It doesn't even run on PHP. Djoonga is a system
that is built using Django at it's core and it interact with Joomla to leverage
Django's capabilities to expand Joomla's abilities.

The great thing about Djoonga is that it doesn't add more clutter to Joomla. It
interacts with Joomla's database without breaking backwards compatibility.It can
be added to any existing Joomla project without breaking anything or doing any
migration.

It's like that perfect new tool that you can just grab and start using.

It's not an improvement, it's a new way to work 
===============================================
Henry Ford once said, 'If Iâ€™d asked people what they wanted, they would have
asked for a better horse'. I think this quote is very applicable to Djoonga.
It's not an incremental improvement on how your work right now, it's a new way
to work.
